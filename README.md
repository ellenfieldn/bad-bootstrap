# bad-bootstrap

A hodgepodge of random junk I've used to setup my systems

You really shouldn't use this. It's a mess.

On Windows machines, I generally dump things in `c:\tools` out of laziness.

## (dis)organization Notes

I currently have all this stuff in `c:\tools`. Shocking, I know, given the above note.

- `AutoHotKey\` - AutoHotKey v2 scripts. I don't actually use these, but I'm pretty sure I wrote them for a reason.
- `bootstrap\` - Random scripts that I run to set things up. Little rhyme or reason to be found
